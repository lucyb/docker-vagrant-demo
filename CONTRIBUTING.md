## How to contribute

If you haven't already, read this [excellent guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) to contributing to a project.

Then, just submit a pull request, making sure there's enough information for us to understand why you are suggesting the change. Ensure that any code is easy to read and in keeping with the existing style.
